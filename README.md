# picogrowery
Raspberry Pi Pico-powered plant grow monitoring setup with a real-time clock, several sensors, and a display. (Modification of the word "microgrowery" since pico- is an SI prefix and also the name of the microcontroller board.)

TODO:
- read pi pico datasheet
- set this thing up with freertos
- pop a cr2032 into the rtc
- draw a diagram

PROJECT ON HIATUS; there are issues with Zephyr's Pi Pico 2 compatibility that must be ironed out.
